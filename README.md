# viewLOD

viewLOD emulates a Linked Data browser or a human browser (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, etc.) and returns the appropriate representation of the specified LOD resource.

Written as a helper app for easyLOD (https://github.com/mjordan/easyLOD) but can be used independently of it.

To use viewLOD, simply enter the resource URI into the 'Resource URI' field in the form, choose whether you want to emulate a LOD (Linked Open Data) browser or a human browser. Hitting the 'Get it' button will return raw XML or HTML representation.
